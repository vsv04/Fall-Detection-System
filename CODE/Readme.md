# Python Code for the Fall Detection System
This folder contains all the Python programs for the fall detection system. The user needs to create a folder **/home/pi/CODE/** on the Raspberry Pi and download all the programs to that folder.

## Pylepton
The [pylepton](https://github.com/vsv04/Fall-Detection-System/tree/master/CODE/pylepton) folder contains the python code for acquiring thermal images from the FLIR Lepton.

## Python code for saving thermal images
The Python program [Save_Images.py](https://github.com/vsv04/Fall-Detection-System/blob/master/CODE/Save_Images.py) captures and saves thermal images for training the fall detection system.
