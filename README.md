# Real-time Fall Detection System for the Elderly Using Deep Learning and Thermal Imaging

This GitHub repository has the programs, hardware list, schematics for the fall detection system developed for a high school research project. This project is open-source and allows individuals to assemble the system, download the Python code and utilize the system. 

The interested reader can download and read the [research paper](https://github.com/vsv04/Fall-Detection-System/blob/master/RESEARCH%20PAPER/Research%20Paper.pdf) which has additional information.
