# Real-time Fall Detection System for the Elderly Using Deep Learning and Thermal Imaging

This GitHub repository hosts the programs, hardware list and the schematics for the fall detection system developed for a high school research project. This project is _**open-source**_ and anyone who is interested can download the instructions for assembling the system along with the Python code and put together a working fall detection system. 

The interested reader can download and read the [**Research Paper**](https://github.com/vsv04/Fall-Detection-System/blob/master/RESEARCH%20PAPER/Research%20Paper.pdf) (pdf document) that discusses the research goal, materials, methods and results. 

## Assembling the Fall Detection System
The [**Components List**](https://github.com/vsv04/Fall-Detection-System/tree/master/COMPONENTS%20LIST) folder has a list of parts needed for the fall detection system. Assembly instructions can be found in the [**Schematics**](https://github.com/vsv04/Fall-Detection-System/tree/master/SCHEMATICS) folder.

## Downloading the Code
The Deep Learning program uses Google's TensorFlow, Keras and OpenCV. Follow the instructions available online for installing [TensorFlow, Keras](https://medium.com/@abhizcc/installing-latest-tensor-flow-and-keras-on-raspberry-pi-aac7dbf95f2) and [OpenCV](https://hackaday.io/project/7008-fly-wars-a-hackers-solution-to-world-hunger/log/23068-installing-opencv-on-a-raspberry-pi-the-easy-way) on the Raspberry Pi. Next, download the Python programs in the [**Code**](https://github.com/vsv04/Fall-Detection-System/tree/master/CODE) folder to the Raspberry Pi.
