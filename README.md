# Real-time Fall Detection System for the Elderly Using Deep Learning and Thermal Imaging

This GitHub repository hosts the programs, hardware list and the schematics for the fall detection system developed for a high school research project. This project is _**open-source**_ and anyone who is interested can download the instructions for assembling the system along with the Python code and put together a working fall detection system. 

The interested reader can download and read the [**Research Paper**](https://github.com/vsv04/Fall-Detection-System/blob/master/RESEARCH%20PAPER/Research%20Paper.pdf) (pdf document) that discusses the research goal, materials, methods and results. 

## Hardware
The [**Parts and Schematics**](https://github.com/vsv04/Fall-Detection-System/tree/master/PARTS%20%26%20SCHEMATICS) folder has a list of parts needed and assembly instructions for the fall detection system.<br/>

## Software Libraries
The Deep Learning program uses Google's TensorFlow and Keras for Deep Learning and OpenCV for image processing. Follow the instructions available online for installing [**TensorFlow, Keras**](https://medium.com/@abhizcc/installing-latest-tensor-flow-and-keras-on-raspberry-pi-aac7dbf95f2) and [**OpenCV**](https://hackaday.io/project/7008-fly-wars-a-hackers-solution-to-world-hunger/log/23068-installing-opencv-on-a-raspberry-pi-the-easy-way) on the Raspberry Pi. Next, download and install [**pylepton**](https://github.com/groupgets/pylepton) which is a Python library for capturing images from the Lepton over SPI. 

## Python Code for Fall Detection
Download the Python programs in the [**Code**](https://github.com/vsv04/Fall-Detection-System/tree/master/CODE) folder to a separate folder (e.g. '\use\home\Fall Detection') on the Raspberry Pi.
